# Real-Time Fraud Detection Dashboard for Indian Stock Market

## Overview

This project is a **Real-Time Fraud Detection Dashboard** designed to monitor Indian stock market trading activities. It detects suspicious behavior and trading fraud using:

- Live data fetched from Yahoo Finance via a Node.js backend proxy.
- Synthetic script-generated trade data for testing and simulation.
- Advanced fraud detection logic analyzing user frequency, price spikes, and trading patterns.
- A buy signal and profit calculator add-on based on moving average crossovers.

The system provides real-time alerts, live trade streams, and visual analytics aimed at identifying potential market manipulations.

## Project Structure

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v12+ recommended)
- Modern web browser (Google Chrome or Firefox recommended)

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

---

### Step 2: Setup and Run Backend Proxy Server

The backend server acts as a proxy to fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance for frontend consumption.

1. Navigate to project folder (already inside `realtime-fraud-detection`):


2. Install Node.js dependencies:


3. Start the backend server:

- The backend server will start on: `http://localhost:3001`
- Ensure this server runs while using the dashboard in real-time mode.

---

### Step 3: Open Frontend Dashboard

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser:

   - Windows: Double-click the file or right-click â†’ Open with â†’ Your browser.
   - macOS/Linux: Open via file manager or browser.

2. The frontend connects to the backend proxy automatically to fetch real-time data (when in real-time mode).

### Step 4: Using the Dashboard

- In the **System Controls**:

  - Select the desired **Stock Symbol** (e.g., TCS, INFY, RELIANCE, etc.).
  - Adjust **User Frequency Threshold**, **Price Spike Threshold (%)**, and **Pattern Anomaly Factor** to tune the fraud detection sensitivity.
  - Choose **Data Source Mode**:
    - **Yahoo Finance Real-time Data**: Uses live market data fetched from backend.
    - **Script Generated Data**: Uses synthetic trade data generated by the frontend for testing/demo.
  - Click **Start Detection** to begin monitoring.

- View real-time:

  - Total trades processed
  - Alerts generated with risk categories
  - Fraud rate percentage
  - Active user count
  - Live price graph (for real-time data)
  - Fraud alerts list and live trade stream
  - Buy Signal & Profit Calculator showing SMA-based buy signals and hypothetical profit/loss.

## Features

- **Fraud Detection Logic** analyzing trade frequency, price spikes, and user trading patterns using Count-Min Sketch and Huffman encoding compression ratio.
- **Live Data Fetching** through a Node.js backend proxy accessing Yahoo Finance API.
- **Simulated Data Mode** for offline testing and demonstration.
- **Buy Signal & Profit Calculator**: A practical tool that uses a moving average crossover strategy (SMA 5 and SMA 15) to suggest buy signals and calculate real-time profit/loss based on user input.
- Intuitive and responsive **UI/UX** with alerts, charts, and trade streams.

---

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Backend must be running** to fetch real-time data; ensure `node server.js` is active.
- If you encounter issues fetching data (Yahoo Finance API errors or rate-limiting), switch to **Script Generated Data** mode.
- For port conflicts, change the backend port in `server.js` if necessary.
- Clear browser cache or hard reload if the UI does not respond as expected.
- Use developer console (F12) for debugging frontend issues.

---

## Development Notes

- Frontend is a standalone HTML file and requires no build process; just open in a browser.
- Backend is a simple Express.js server with CORS enabled to allow local frontend connections.
- The backend fetches Yahoo Finance market data without requiring an API key.
- The fraud detection logic and buy signal calculation run entirely in the frontend using standard JavaScript.
